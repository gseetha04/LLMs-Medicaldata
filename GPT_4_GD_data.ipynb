        "Benefits of early detection and intervention and treatmentThere is inadequate direct evidence that screening for gestational diabetes improves health outcomes.\n",
        "There is adequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected gestational diabetes is associated with moderate improvements in maternal and fetal outcomes, including primary (first) cesarean delivery, macrosomia, large for gestational age infants, shoulder dystocia, birth injury, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.\n",
        "Harms of early detection and intervention and treatmentThere is adequate evidence that the harms of screening for gestational diabetes, such as anxiety, depression, and labeling, are small.\n",
        "There is adequate evidence that the harms of treatment of gestational diabetes, such as maternal hypoglycemia and low birth weight, are small.\n",
        "USPSTF Assessment of Magnitude of Net BenefitPregnant Persons at 24 Weeks of Gestation or AfterThe US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit to screening for gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after to improve maternal and fetal outcomes.\n",
        "Definitions of Gestational DiabetesDuring pregnancy, insulin resistance increases, leading to higher glucose intolerance and development of gestational diabetes in some pregnant persons.\n",
        "Assessment of RiskSeveral factors increase a persons risk for developing gestational diabetes, including obesity, increased maternal age, history of gestational diabetes, family history of diabetes, and belonging to a racial/ethnic group that is at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, or Pacific Islander descent).4,19,20 Factors associated with a lower risk for developing gestational diabetes include age younger than 25 to 30 years, White race, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or less (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), no family history (in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to gestational diabetes.21-23 The risk in different racial/ethnic groups may be due in part to social risk factors such as low socioeconomic status or structural racism, although these associations are not examined in the current evidence.\n",
        "Although a higher BMI increases the risk of gestational diabetes across racial/ethnic groups, the association varies.\n",
        "In Asian American persons, the prevalence of gestational diabetes at a BMI of 22 to less than 25 is similar to the prevalence in Hispanic persons, non-Hispanic White persons, and Black persons with a higher (>28) BMI.24,25Screening TestsScreening for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic persons involves either a 2-step (screening test followed by a diagnostic test) or 1-step (diagnostic test used for all patients) approach.\n",
        "In the US, a 2-step approach is commonly used.8,26 A 50-g oral glucose chal- lenge test (OGCT) is performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state.\n",
        "If the screening threshold is met or exceeded, patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\n",
        "During the OGTT, a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 75-g or 100-g glucose load, then evaluation of glucose levels after 1, 2, and often 3 hours.\n",
        "Pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or after\\nScreen for gestational diabetes.Grade: BPregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestationThe evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for screening for gestational diabetes.\n",
        "Screen: If the person is pregnant and is at least 24 weeks of gestation, screen for gestational diabetes by using 1 of several methods:A 2-step process that involves a screening test (oral glucose challenge test) followed by a diagnostic test (oral glucose tolerance test).\n",
        "A diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made when 2 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds.27In the 1-step approach, a 75-g glucose load is administered after a fasting glucose level is obtained, and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours.\n",
        "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends testing between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation.1 Pregnant persons whose first prenatal visit happens after 28 weeks of gestation (ie, late entry into prenatal care) should bescreened as soon as possible.\n",
        "Potential Preventable BurdenBetween 2006 and 2016, there was an absolute increase of 3.6% in the prevalence of gestational diabetes.7 Pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications and may benefit from early identification and treatment.\n",
        "They are also at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy.29 Pregnant persons who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation may be at even greater risk for maternal and fetal complications.29Potential HarmsPotential harms of screening for gestational diabetes include psychological harms (anxiety, depression), intensive medical interventions (induction of labor, cesarean delivery, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]), and negative hospital experiences related to labeling (reduction in breastfeeding and fewer newborns staying in the mothers room) that may be associated with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes.\n",
        "Race/ethnicity was fairly diverse in several studies, although 2 of the largest studies with treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after enrolled large proportions of White (75%) and Chinese (97%) persons.29,34,37,38Treatment of gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after was associated with decreased risk of primary cesarean deliveries (relative risk [RR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.91]; absolute risk difference [ARD], 5.3%; 3 trials) and preterm deliveries, although findings for the latter are not statistically significant (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56-1.01]; ARD, 2.3%; 4 trials).29,34 Treatment of gestational diabetes was not associated with reduced risk of preeclampsia in the included studies (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.46-2.16]; 6 trials).29 Addi- tionally, treatment was not associated with reduced risk of gestational hypertension (2 trials), total cesarean deliveries (8 trials), emergency cesarean deliveries (1 trial), induction of labor (5 trials), or maternal birth trauma (2 trials).29,34For fetal/neonatal outcomes, treatment of gestational diabetes at 24 weeks of gestation or after was associated with reduced risk of shoulder dystocia (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.23-0.77]; ARD, 1.3%;3 trials), macrosomia (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41-0.68]; ARD, 8.9%; 8 trials), LGA infants (RR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.47-0.66]; ARD, 8.4%; 7 trials), birth injury (eg, fracture or nerve palsies) (odds ratio, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.11-0.99]; ARD, 0.2%), and NICU admissions (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53-0.99]; ARD, 2%; 5 trials).29,34 No association was found for several outcomes, including mortality (stillbirth, neona- tal, or perinatal), respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycemia (any or clinical), and hyperbilirubinemia.\n",
        "One study found that gestational diabetes diagnosis and labeling may be associated with higher rates of cesarean delivery.29,34Harms associated with the treatment of gestational diabetes were evaluated in 13 trials (11 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized clinical trials; n = 4235).29,34 Treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after was not associated with an increased risk for severe maternal hypoglycemia, low birth weight, or small for gestational age infants.\n",
        "Treatment of gestational diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of macrosomia (>4000 g) (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68]) but no difference in the risk of total number of cesarean deliveries (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.08]).29,34 This suggests that a small proportion of pregnant persons may undergo cesarean delivery because of gestational diabetes diagnosis alone.\n",

            "23. <C>One study found that gestational diabetes diagnosis and labeling may be associated with higher rates of cesarean delivery.29,34Harms associated with the treatment of gestational diabetes were evaluated in 13 trials (11 RCTs and 2 nonrandomized clinical trials; n = 4235).29,34 Treatment at 24 weeks of gestation or after was not associated with an increased risk for severe maternal hypoglycemia, low birth weight, or small for gestational age infants.</C>\n",

            "20. Although patients are not typically obese when they present with type 1 diabetes, obesity is increasingly common in the general population and there is evidence that it may also be a risk factor for type 1 diabetes.\n",
            "21. People with type 1 diabetes are also prone to other autoimmune disorders such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, celiac disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, auto- immune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia (see Section 4 \"Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities,\" https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-S004).\n",
            "22. Individuals with autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes of African or Asian ancestry may suffer from episodic DKA and exhibit varying degrees of insulin deficiency between episodes.\n",
            "23. Multiple studies indicate that measuring islet autoantibodies in individuals genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes (e.g., relatives of those with type 1 diabetes or indi- viduals from the general population with type 1 diabetes-associated genetic factors) identifies individuals who may develop type 1 diabetes (9).\n",
            "24. Indeed, the risk of type 1 diabetes increases as the number of relevant autoantibodies detected increases (43-45).\n",
            "25. PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES2.13 Risk based screening for prediabetes and/or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier, in children and adolescents with overweight (BMI >85th percen- tile) or obesity (BMI >95th per- centile) and who have one or more risk factor for diabetes.\n",
            "26. If results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status.\n",
            "27. It should be noted that theTable 2.4Risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic children and adolescents in a clinical setting (163)Testingshould be considered in youth* who have overweight (>85th percentile) or obesity (>95th percentile) and who have one or more additional risk factors based on the strength of their association with diabetes:Maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the childs gestation AFamily history of type 2 diabetes in rst- or second-degree relative ARace/ethnicity (Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacic Islander) ASigns of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, or small-for-gestational- age birth weight) BGDM, gestational diabetes mellitus.\n",
            "28. If tests are normal, repeat testing at a minimum of 3-year intervals, or more frequently if BMI is increasing, is recommended.\n",
            "29. Those with an A1C range of 6.0- 6.5% (42-48 mmol/mol) had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% and 50% and a relative risk 20 times higher compared with A1C of 5.0% (31 mmol/mol) (49).\n",
            "30. Similar to those with IFG and/or IGT, individuals with A1C of 5.7-6.4% (39-47 mmol/mol) should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and CVD and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see Section 3 \"Prevention or Delay of Type 2 Di- abetes,\" https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20- S003).\n",
            "31. Similar to glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so as A1C rises, the diabetes risk rises disproportionately (49).\n",
            "32. Aggressive interventions and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk (e.g., those with A1C .6.0% [42 mmol/mol]).\n",
            "33. Excess weight itself causes some degree of insulin resistance.\n",
            "34. DKA seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in association with the stress of another illness such as infection or with the use of certain drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) (53,54).\n",
            "35. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity.\n",
            "36. After 5.3 years of follow-up, CVD risk factors were modestly but significantly improved with intensive treatment compared with routine care, but the incidence of first CVD events or mortality was not significantly different between the groups (48).\n",

            "38. CYSTIC FIBROSIS-RELATED DIABETESRecommendationsAnnual screening for cystic brosisrelated diabetes (CFRD) with an oral glucose tolerance test should begin by age 10 years in all patients with cystic brosis not previously diagnosed with CFRD.\n",
            "39. BPatients with cystic brosis related diabetes should be treated with insulin to attain individualized glycemic goals.\n",
            "40. ABeginning 5 years after the diagnosis of cystic brosisrelated diabetes, annual monitoring for complications of diabetes is recommended.\n",
            "41. Diabetes in this population, compared with individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is associated with worse nutritional status, more severe infiammatory lung disease, and greater mortality.\n",
            "42. Genetically determined b-cell function and insulin resistance associated with infection and infiammation may also contribute to the development of CFRD.\n",
            "43. EThe oral glucose tolerance test is the preferred test to make a diagnosis of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus.\n",
            "44. Most studies have reported that transplant patients with hyperglycemia and PTDM after transplantation have higher rates of rejection, infection, and rehospitalization (89,91,96).\n",
            "45. Those with previously poor control or with persistent hyperglycemia should continue insulin with frequent home self-monitoring of blood glucose to determine when insulin dose reductions may be needed and when it may be appropriate to switch to non- insulin agents.\n",
            "46. Drug dose adjustments may be required because of decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, a relatively common complication in transplant patients.\n",
            "47. Thiazolidinediones have been used successfully in patients with liver and kidney transplants, but side effects include fiuid retention, heart failure, and osteopenia (98,99).\n",
            "48. Well-designed intervention trials examining the efficacy and safety of these and other antihyperglycemic agents in patients with PTDM are needed.\n",
            "49. MONOGENIC DIABETES SYNDROMESRecommendationsAll children diagnosed with diabetes in the rst 6 months of life should have immediate genetic testing for neonatal diabetes.\n",
            "50. AChildren and those diagnosed in early adulthood who have diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes that occurs in successive generations (suggestive of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheri- tance) should have genetic test- ing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young.\n",

            "55. Insulin gene (INS) mutations are the second most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes, and, while intensive insulin management is currently the preferred treatment strategy, there are important genetic counseling considerations, as most of the mutations that cause diabetes are dominantly inherited.\n",
            "56. Clinically, patients with GCK-MODY exhibit mild, stable, fasting hyperglycemia and do not require antihyperglycemic therapy except sometimes during pregnancy.\n",
            "57. Mutations or deletions in HNF1B are associated with renal cysts and uterine malformations (renal cysts and diabetes [RCAD] syndrome).\n",
            "58. Additionally, diagnosis can lead to identification of other affected family members.\n",
            "59. A diagnosis of MODY should be considered in individuals who have atypical diabetes and multiple family members with diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, although admittedly \"atypical diabetes\" is becoming increasingly difficult to precisely define in the absence of a definitive set of tests for either type of diabetes (104-110).\n",
            "60. In most cases, the presence of autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes precludes further testing for monogenic diabetes, but the presence of autoantibodies in patients with monogenic diabetes has been reported (111).\n",
            "61. Individuals in whom monogenic diabetes is suspected should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation if available, and consultation is available from several centers.\n",
            "62. It is critical to correctly diagnose one of the monogenic forms of diabetes because these patients may be incorrectly diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to suboptimal, even potentially harmful, treatment regimens and delays in diagnosing other family members (114).\n",
            "63. Genetic counseling is recommended to ensure that affected individuals understand the patterns of inheritance and the importance of a correct diagnosis.\n",
            "64. The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes should be considered in children and adults diagnosed with diabetes in early adulthood with the following findings: Diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life (with occasional cases presenting later, mostly INS and ABCC8 mutations) (103,116) Diabetes without typical features of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, non- obese, lacking other metabolic features especially with strong family history of diabetes) Stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia (100-150 mg/dL [5.5-8.5 mmol/L]),stable A1C between 5.6 and 7.6%(between 38 and 60 mmol/mol), especially if nonobesePANCREATIC DIABETES OR DIABETES IN THE CONTEXT OF DISEASE OF THE EXOCRINE PANCREASPancreatic diabetes includes both structural and functional loss of glucose- normalizing insulin secretion in the context of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and is commonly misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes.\n",

            "66. In the context of pancreatectomy, islet autotransplantation can be done to retain insulin secretion (123,124).\n",

        "The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (141), a large-scale multinational cohort study completed by more than 23,000 pregnant women, demonstrated that risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased as a function of maternal glycemia at 24-28 weeks of gestation, even within ranges previously considerednormal for pregnancy.\n",
        "This one-step strategy was anticipated to significantly increase the incidence of GDM (from 5-6% to 15- 20%), primarily because only one abnormal value, not two, became sufficient to make the diagnosis (142).\n",
        "A recent follow-up study of women participating in a blinded study of pregnancy OGTTs found that 11 years after their pregnancies, women who would have been diagnosed with GDM by the one-step approach, as compared with those without, were at 3.4-fold higher risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and had children with a higher risk of obesity and increased body fat, suggesting that the larger group of women identified by the one-step approach would benefit from increased screening for diabetes and prediabetes that would accompany a history of GDM(144).\n",
        "Table 2.7Screening for and diagnosis of GDMOne-step strategyPerform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when patient is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 2428 weeks of gestation in women not previously diagnosed with diabetes.\n",

        "Additional well-designed clinical studies are needed to determine the optimal intensity of monitoring and treatment of women with GDM diagnosed by the one-step strategy (147,148).\n",

        "Definitions of Gestational DiabetesDuring pregnancy, insulin resistance increases, leading to higher glucose intolerance and development of gestational diabetes in some pregnant persons.\n",
        "Assessment of RiskSeveral factors increase a persons risk for developing gestational diabetes, including obesity, increased maternal age, history of gestational diabetes, family history of diabetes, and belonging to a racial/ethnic group that is at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes (Hispanic, Native American, South or East Asian, or Pacific Islander descent).4,19,20 Factors associated with a lower risk for developing gestational diabetes include age younger than 25 to 30 years, White race, a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or less (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), no family history (in a first-degree relative) of diabetes, and no history of glucose intolerance or adverse pregnancy outcomes related to gestational diabetes.21-23 The risk in different racial/ethnic groups may be due in part to social risk factors such as low socioeconomic status or structural racism, although these associations are not examined in the current evidence.\n",
        "Although a higher BMI increases the risk of gestational diabetes across racial/ethnic groups, the association varies.\n",
        "In Asian American persons, the prevalence of gestational diabetes at a BMI of 22 to less than 25 is similar to the prevalence in Hispanic persons, non-Hispanic White persons, and Black persons with a higher (>28) BMI.24,25Screening TestsScreening for gestational diabetes in asymptomatic persons involves either a 2-step (screening test followed by a diagnostic test) or 1-step (diagnostic test used for all patients) approach.\n",
        "In the US, a 2-step approach is commonly used.8,26 A 50-g oral glucose chal- lenge test (OGCT) is performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in a nonfasting state.\n",
        "If the screening threshold is met or exceeded, patients receive the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\n",
        "During the OGTT, a fasting glucose level is obtained, followed by administration of a 75-g or 100-g glucose load, then evaluation of glucose levels after 1, 2, and often 3 hours.\n",
        "Pregnant persons at 24 weeks of gestation or after\\nScreen for gestational diabetes.Grade: BPregnant persons before 24 weeks of gestationThe evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for screening for gestational diabetes.\n",
        "Screen: If the person is pregnant and is at least 24 weeks of gestation, screen for gestational diabetes by using 1 of several methods:A 2-step process that involves a screening test (oral glucose challenge test) followed by a diagnostic test (oral glucose tolerance test).\n",
        "A diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made when 2 or more glucose values fall at or above the specified glucose thresholds.27In the 1-step approach, a 75-g glucose load is administered after a fasting glucose level is obtained, and plasma glucose levels are evaluated after 1 and 2 hours.\n",
        "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends testing between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation.1 Pregnant persons whose first prenatal visit happens after 28 weeks of gestation (ie, late entry into prenatal care) should bescreened as soon as possible.\n",
        "Potential Preventable BurdenBetween 2006 and 2016, there was an absolute increase of 3.6% in the prevalence of gestational diabetes.7 Pregnant persons with gestational diabetes are at increased risk for maternal and fetal complications and may benefit from early identification and treatment.\n",
        "They are also at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy.29 Pregnant persons who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes before 24 weeks of gestation may be at even greater risk for maternal and fetal complications.29Potential HarmsPotential harms of screening for gestational diabetes include psychological harms (anxiety, depression), intensive medical interventions (induction of labor, cesarean delivery, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [NICU]), and negative hospital experiences related to labeling (reduction in breastfeeding and fewer newborns staying in the mothers room) that may be associated with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes.\n",
